Data Science,RetinalGenix Reports on its Science and Mission in Light of New AI-Driven Retinal Mapping Study,"APOLLO BEACH, Fla., Jan. 14, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RetinalGenix Technologies Inc. [OTCQB: RTGN] ('RetinalGenix” or the 'Company”), a company developing ultra-high-resolution retinal imaging technology, today announced that a recent large‑scale Australian retinal mapping study, which used artificial intelligence to analyze approximately 50,000 retinal scans, reported that specific patterns of retinal thinning are associated with neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases such as dementia, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. These findings support the broader field of oculomics and reinforce the premise that high‑quality retinal images, analyzed with advanced algorithms and integrated with genetic and clinical data, could become an important tool for earlier detection, risk stratification, and ongoing monitoring of disease. RetinalGenix’s core thesis-that combining high‑resolution imaging, genetics, and advanced analytics may unlock new insights into ocular and systemic health-is expected to position the Company to benefit as this field continues to mature.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/01/14/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/retinalgenix-reports-on-its-science-and-mission-in-light-of-new-ai-driven-retinal-mapping-study/2258678,2026-01-14T11:10:08Z,The Manila Times,https://www.manilatimes.net
